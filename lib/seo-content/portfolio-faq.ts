        question: "Is my portfolio data really private? Can ApexWeb3 see my holdings?",
        answer: "Your portfolio data is completely private through our architecture-level privacy design. We use browser localStorage instead of cloud databases, meaning your holdings never leave your device. Let me explain technically why we literally cannot access your data even if we wanted to.\n\nLocalStorage architecture: When you add assets to your portfolio, that information is stored using your browser's localStorage API—a client-side storage mechanism that keeps data on your device, not our servers. It's analogous to writing in a notebook on your desk versus mailing that notebook to our office. The data physically remains on your computer.\n\nNo server database: ApexWeb3 has no backend database collecting portfolio information. Our servers don't receive, store, or process your holdings data. When you view portfolio data, your browser reads from localStorage and calculates values locally. We cannot query your portfolio from our infrastructure because that data doesn't exist in our systems.\n\nNetwork traffic verification: You can verify this by opening browser developer tools (F12), navigating to the Network tab, and watching traffic while using our portfolio tracker. You'll see price data requests to CoinGecko API, but zero transmissions of your holdings data to our servers. Industry experts can audit our code and confirm no portfolio data is transmitted.\n\nGDPR compliance by design: We're GDPR compliant not through privacy policies but through architectural impossibility of data collection. There's no personal data to protect because we never collect it. No opt-outs needed, no data deletion requests necessary, no regulatory concerns—the data simply isn't in our custody.\n\nComparison to competitors: Platforms like CoinStats, Delta, or Blockfolio that offer cloud sync store your portfolio on their servers. This enables convenient multi-device access but means the company can see every token you hold, every trade you make, and your complete financial position. They could be compelled by court orders to share this data, or hackers could breach their databases exposing your holdings.\n\nTradeoffs of our approach: The privacy benefit means we don't offer automatic cross-device synchronization. If you use our tracker on your phone and desktop, they maintain separate localStorage databases. Workaround: export CSV from one device and import to another (upcoming feature). Some browsers sync localStorage across devices when signed into browser accounts (Chrome, Firefox).\n\nWhat happens to your data: Clearing browser data deletes your portfolio permanently from that device—we cannot recover it because we never had it. Incognito/private browsing mode doesn't persist data after closing browser. Different browsers on same device have separate localStorage. Browser updates don't affect localStorage (data persists).\n\nBest practices for privacy: Export regular CSV backups (stays local unless you upload somewhere), use VPN if extra paranoid (though we don't log IPs anyway), don't access from public computers unless using incognito mode, understand that privacy tradeoff is manual backups versus automatic cloud sync."

        question: "What happens if I clear my browser data?",
        answer: "Clearing browser data permanently deletes your portfolio from that device with no possibility of recovery. Understanding this is crucial to avoid losing your investment tracking records.\n\nImmediate effect: Browser data clearing removes all localStorage, which is where your portfolio data resides. This deletion is instantaneous and permanent. Your holdings list, purchase prices, quantities, notes, custom categories—everything vanishes. There is no 'undo' button, no server backup to restore from, no recovery process. The data is simply gone.\n\nWhy we can't recover it: Since we never received or stored your portfolio data on our servers, we have nothing to restore. It's like losing a physical notebook—we can't recreate notes we never saw. This is a direct consequence of our privacy-first architecture. The same feature that protects your privacy (no server storage) means no recovery is possible.\n\nWhat triggers data loss: Clicking 'Clear browsing data' in browser settings (usually clears all storage), selecting 'Clear history' or 'Reset browser' options, uninstalling and reinstalling browser without syncing, using cleaning software (CCleaner, etc.) that wipes storage, factory resetting device, some antivirus scans that clean temporary files, switching browser profiles or creating new profiles.\n\nWhat doesn't affect portfolio data: Clearing cookies alone (localStorage is separate from cookies), clearing cache (different storage mechanism), closing and reopening browser (localStorage persists), browser updates or system updates (localStorage survives), temporary browsing in incognito then returning to normal mode (normal mode localStorage unaffected).\n\nSelective clearing: Most browsers let you choose what to clear. You can usually clear cookies and cache while preserving site data / localStorage. Navigate carefully: Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Advanced → uncheck 'Site settings' and 'Hosted app data'. Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data → uncheck 'Site data'. Safari: Has less granular control, be extra careful.\n\nPrevention strategies: Export CSV backups regularly (weekly or monthly habit), save exports to cloud storage or multiple locations, use browser sync features if comfortable (Google Chrome sync, Firefox Sync preserve localStorage across devices), document holdings in separate system (spreadsheet, notebook) as redundancy, screenshot portfolio periodically as simple backup.\n\nRecovery from backup: If you've exported CSV previously, you can rebuild portfolio by manually re-entering holdings from the export. We're developing CSV import functionality to make restoration easier. Until then, it's manual entry of each asset from your backup CSV.\n\nBrowser switching considerations: Moving from Chrome to Firefox? They have completely separate localStorage. You must export from Chrome before switching, then manually rebuild in Firefox. Same applies to any browser migration.\n\nComputer/device replacement: New device = new localStorage. Export from old device before migration. Cloud-based browser profiles (signed into Chrome/Firefox account) may sync localStorage automatically, but verify before assuming."

        question: "Can I access my portfolio on different devices?",
        answer: "Currently, portfolio data does not automatically sync across devices because we prioritize privacy over convenience. Each device maintains its own separate localStorage database. However, several workarounds and future features enable multi-device portfolio management.\n\nWhy no automatic sync: Automatic cross-device syncing requires storing your portfolio data on servers we control (cloud database), which fundamentally conflicts with our privacy-first architecture. We chose privacy—keeping data on your device—over convenience of universal access. This means your laptop and phone maintain separate portfolio databases by default.\n\nBrowser sync functionality: Some modern browsers offer built-in cross-device sync when signed into browser accounts. Google Chrome (signed into Google account), Firefox (signed into Firefox account), and Safari (signed into iCloud) sync localStorage across their respective ecosystems. This happens at the browser level, not our application level. We don't control this data, the browser does.\n\nHow browser sync works: Sign into same browser account on multiple devices (Google account for Chrome, Firefox account for Firefox), enable 'Sync' in browser settings, verify 'App data' or 'Site data' is included in sync settings, wait for synchronization (can take minutes to hours), open ApexWeb3 tools on second device, portfolio should appear identical to first device.\n\nLimitations of browser sync: Only works within same browser family (Chrome on laptop and Chrome on phone, not Chrome to Firefox), requires trusting browser vendor with data (Google, Mozilla, Apple can theoretically access synced data), sync can be delayed or fail due to connection issues, some browsers encrypt synced data, others may not.\n\nManual sync workaround: Export portfolio as CSV from Device A, transfer CSV to Device B via email, cloud storage, or USB, manually re-enter holdings on Device B from CSV (upcoming feature: CSV import makes this easier), keep both devices updated as you make changes, periodic re-synchronization needed.\n\nChoosing primary device: For most users, we recommend selecting one primary device for portfolio management—typically your desktop or whichever device you use most for crypto research. Use other devices for viewing price data and quick checks rather than full portfolio management.\n\nFuture encrypted sync feature: We're developing optional end-to-end encrypted cloud sync where you control the encryption key. How it would work: You opt into sync, create encryption password, your encrypted portfolio uploads to cloud storage, other devices decrypt with your password, we never have access to unencrypted data, you control security versus convenience tradeoff.\n\nSecurity considerations: Any sync mechanism increases attack surface. Local-only storage has zero remote attack vectors. Cloud sync (even encrypted) introduces server security, key management, and potential vulnerabilities. Weigh convenience against security based on your threat model and portfolio size."

        question: "How accurate are the price updates?",
        answer: "Our price data is highly accurate for portfolio monitoring purposes, sourced from CoinGecko's aggregated exchange feed with 30-60 second refresh rates. Accuracy sits within 1-2% of real-time global market prices, which is perfectly suitable for tracking investments but not for executing split-second trades.\n\nData source: CoinGecko API aggregates cryptocurrency prices from 600+ exchanges worldwide using volume-weighted averaging. This methodology eliminates outliers and regional anomalies, providing prices that reflect true global market consensus rather than any single exchange's idiosyncrasies.\n\nUpdate frequency: Prices refresh every 30-60 seconds while you're actively viewing the portfolio. This is near-real-time for tracking purposes—you'll see major price movements within a minute. When browser is backgrounded or inactive, updates may slow to conserve resources and reduce API calls, but refresh immediately when you return to the page.\n\nWhy prices differ from exchanges: Your specific exchange (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) might show slightly different prices due to: regional premiums or discounts (crypto.com prices in Asia differ from Coinbase in US), exchange-specific liquidity (low volume tokens have wider spreads), trading fees included or excluded (some exchanges show pre-fee prices), temporary arbitrage opportunities (cross-exchange price differences), exchange outages or delays (CoinGecko continues aggregating from other sources).\n\nAccuracy by token type: Major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, major altcoins) have 99%+ accuracy with minimal variance. Mid-cap tokens (established projects $100M-$1B market cap) show high accuracy, usually within 0.5-1%. Small-cap and micro-cap tokens may have less consistent data due to low liquidity and sparse trading, variance up to 2-3%. Newly listed tokens might have incomplete data initially (gaps filled within hours/days).\n\nExtreme market conditions: During flash crashes, exchanges may halt trading or experience downtime while CoinGecko continues aggregating from functioning exchanges. This can create temporary discrepancies. During extreme volatility (market-wide crashes or pumps), prices change so rapidly that 30-60 second delays mean displayed prices trail true real-time by up to 2-3%. For normal market conditions, delays are negligible.\n\nFor active trading: If day trading or attempting to time exact entries/exits, always verify prices on your specific exchange before executing. Our displayed prices guide decision-making but shouldn't be your sole source for trade execution. For portfolio tracking, investment monitoring, and general market awareness, our accuracy is excellent.\n\nManual refresh: If you suspect prices are stale or want immediate updates, you can manually refresh the page. We're adding a refresh button for on-demand price updates without full page reload.\n\nHistorical accuracy: Past price data (for calculating purchase gains/losses) is accurate to CoinGecko's historical records. Historical prices don't change retroactively, so your cost basis calculations remain consistent even if current price methodology evolves."

        question: "Can I track NFTs in this portfolio?",
        answer: "Currently, ApexWeb3 portfolio tracker is optimized for fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies) rather than NFTs (non-fungible tokens). While you technically can track NFTs with workarounds, dedicated NFT portfolio tools provide better functionality for that specific asset class.\n\nWhy NFT tracking differs: Fungible tokens have clear, unified pricing—every USDC or Bitcoin is worth the same. NFTs are unique with individual valuations based on traits, rarity, historical sales, and subjective market perception. Fungible tokens trade continuously on liquid markets. NFTs sell sporadically with large gaps between transactions. Pricing APIs for fungible tokens are straightforward (ticker price). NFT valuation requires floor prices, trait analysis, collection trends, and individual appraisals.\n\nCurrent limitations: Our tracker doesn't have NFT-specific pricing APIs (don't pull floor prices from OpenSea, Blur, etc.), can't evaluate individual NFT traits or rarity, lacks collection-level analytics (floor price trends, volume), doesn't display NFT images or metadata, can't track offers or listing status.\n\nWorkaround for simple tracking: You can manually add NFTs as custom assets. Enter NFT name (e.g., 'Bored Ape #1234'), enter quantity as 1, manually enter purchase price (what you paid in ETH converted to USD), periodically update current price based on floor prices or appraisals, use notes field to track collection name and identifying information.\n\nWhen this workaround makes sense: If you own just a few NFTs and primarily track crypto, if you want combined view of all digital assets in one place, if you're comfortable with manual price updates, if you treat NFTs as long-term holdings not actively traded, if you value simplicity over detailed NFT analytics.\n\nWhen to use dedicated NFT tools: If NFTs are significant portion of your portfolio, if you trade NFTs actively (need real-time floor prices), if you own many NFTs across multiple collections, if you want trait analysis and rarity rankings, if you need integration with OpenSea/Blur for listing management. Recommended dedicated tools: NFT Bank, Floor.xyz, or built-in portfolio features on OpenSea.\n\nFuture NFT features: We're evaluating whether to add NFT tracking, which would include: floor price integration from major marketplaces, collection-level analytics, trend charts for NFT collections, optional integration with wallet addresses to auto-import NFTs, image display for owned NFTs. However, this is lower priority than core crypto features.\n\nMixed portfolio strategy: Use ApexWeb3 for crypto portfolio, use dedicated NFT tracker for NFTs, manually combine total portfolio value from both tools, focus each tool on what it does best rather than forcing one tool to do everything poorly."

        question: "What should I do before tax season?",
        answer: "Cryptocurrency tax preparation requires detailed records of all transactions, cost basis calculations, and profit/loss determinations. ApexWeb3 portfolio tracker can help organize this data, though you'll likely need dedicated tax software or professional help for final filing.\n\nQ4 preparation (October-December): Review portfolio holdings for accuracy (verify all positions are recorded, check purchase prices match exchange records, add any missing transactions), consider tax-loss harvesting (sell underwater positions to offset gains, be aware of wash sale rules may apply to crypto in your jurisdiction, reinvest after appropriate waiting period if desired), project tax liability (calculate estimated gains, set aside funds to cover tax bill, consult with tax professional for accurate estimates).\n\nJanuary actions: Export CSV as soon as calendar year ends (comprehensive records ready for tax software or accountant, portfolio snapshot for year-end reporting), download exchange records (collect all trade histories from Coinbase, Binance, etc., some exchanges delete old data so download promptly, verify transactions match your portfolio records), organize additional documentation (staking/lending/DeFi proceed records, airdrops and forks received, gifts or donations of crypto).\n\nCost basis methodology: ApexWeb3 shows your entered purchase prices, but tax reporting requires specific methods: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) is default in many jurisdictions—oldest purchases sell first. Specific identification lets you choose which tax lots to sell. Average cost averages all purchase prices. Consult tax advisor on which method applies in your country and optimizes your situation.\n\nWhat to export from our tracker: All holdings with quantities and purchase prices, current values for year-end portfolio valuation, notes about acquisition dates and sources, realized gains (calculate from sold positions), unrealized gains (current holdings above cost).\n\nTax software integration: Our CSV export works with most crypto tax software (CoinTracker, Koinly, CryptoTrader.Tax, TokenTax, etc.). Upload our export along with exchange API connections or CSVs, software reconciles data and calculates tax liability, generates required forms for filing (Form 8949, Schedule D in US).\n\nWorking with accountants: CPAs specializing in cryptocurrency prefer organized records. Provide: exported CSV from our tracker, all exchange trade histories, records of income events (staking rewards, interest, airdrops), detailed notes on unusual transactions (hacks, losses, gifts), explanation of any discrepancies between records.\n\nCommon tax reporting mistakes: Missing small transactions (even $10 trades must be reported in many jurisdictions), incorrect cost basis (from poor record-keeping), forgetting income events (staking, lending, mining all taxable), not reporting crypto-to-crypto trades (often taxable events, not just crypto-to-fiat).\n\nMulti-year preparation: Start organizing now rather than scrambling at deadline, maintain detailed records throughout the year not just annual cleanup, export monthly or quarterly CSV backups, consider estimated tax payments if you have large gains.\n\nDisclaimers: This is general guidance, not tax advice. Cryptocurrency tax rules vary dramatically by country and change frequently. Consult qualified tax professionals in your jurisdiction for definitive requirement."
