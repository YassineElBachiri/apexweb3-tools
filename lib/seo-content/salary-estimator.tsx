            question: "How is a crypto salary calculated?",
            answer: "Most crypto salaries are denominated in fiat (e.g., $100,000/year) but paid in crypto. The amount of crypto you receive each payday depends on the market price at the exact time of payment. For example, if you earn $4,000/month and Bitcoin is $40,000, you receive 0.1 BTC. If Bitcoin drops to $20,000, you receive 0.2 BTC."
        },
        {
            question: "Do I have to pay taxes on crypto income?",
            answer: "Yes, in most jurisdictions (like the US, UK, and EU), receiving cryptocurrency as payment for services is considered a taxable event. You typically owe income tax on the fair market value of the crypto at the time of receipt. If you hold the crypto and it increases in value, you may also owe capital gains tax when you sell."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the benefit of being paid in crypto?",
            answer: "Getting paid in crypto allows for immediate ownership of assets, potentially faster cross-border payments, and the ability to participate in the crypto ecosystem (DeFi, staking) immediately. It effectively automates a Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) investment strategy."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I split my salary between fiat and crypto?",
            answer: "Yes! Many platforms like BitWage or Request Finance allow you to split your paycheck. Consuming a portion in stablecoins (USDC/USDT) for living expenses while saving the rest in Bitcoin or Ethereum is a popular strategy to manage volatility risk."
        },
        {
            question: "Is this financial advice?",
            answer: "No. This calculator is for educational and informational purposes only. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor and tax professional before making employment or investment decisions."
